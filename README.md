# Front-end Challenge

### REFRESHER Trends

Trends are essential part of REFRESHER's content. Bounded within the application they are our blog content. Therefore, we rely on their good quality, free availability and search engine optimization to engage more people.

Currently, a trend page is composed by 6 principal elements: `header`, `breadcrumb`, `post content`, `share buttons`, `related content` and `comment box`. Here are some examples:
- https://www.refresher.com.br/tendencias/maximizando-a-usabilidade-parte-ii
- https://www.refresher.com.br/tendencias/design-para-os-sentidos-parte-ii
